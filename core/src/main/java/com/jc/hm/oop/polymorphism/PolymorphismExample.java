/**
 * Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
 * We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.
 * There are two types of polymorphism in java: compile time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.
 * - Compile time polymorphism can be achieved by method overloading.
 *   + It is also known as static polymorphism.
 * - Runtime polymorphism can be achieved by method overriding.
 *   + It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch.
 *   + It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime.
